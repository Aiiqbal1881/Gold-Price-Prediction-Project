# Gold-Price-Prediction-Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict gold prices using Machine Learning techniques, specifically utilizing the **RandomForestRegressor** model. The dataset contains historical gold price data, and we analyze it using Python and visualization libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language for data processing and model building.
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive modeling using **RandomForestRegressor**.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Model training, evaluation, and performance analysis.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gold-price-prediction.git
   cd gold-price-prediction
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical gold price data, including relevant financial indicators that impact gold price trends. Ensure the dataset is placed in the working directory before running the script.

## Usage
1. Run the script to train the model and predict gold prices:
   ```bash
   python gold_price_prediction.py
   ```
2. The script will output predictions and visualizations to help understand the model's performance.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Machine Learning model training using RandomForestRegressor
- Model evaluation and prediction visualization

## Results
The model predicts gold prices based on historical data, and results are visualized for better interpretation. Feature importance analysis is also performed to understand key factors affecting gold prices.

## Contributions
Feel free to contribute by opening issues or submitting pull requests to improve the model and analysis.
